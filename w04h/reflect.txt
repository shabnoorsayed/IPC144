At home part of this workshop was a bit challenging as i was stuck when we had to find the average as each time i was trying for the check of 0 days it was exiting with goodbye status instead of invalid entry and finally i found that i was just putting a incomplete check so i was using while(days>0){} and then i corrected it with while(days>=0){} and after that everything worked fine. When i started doing this workshop i felt that it would be tough and maybe i won't be able to do it but as i worked through the problem in small step everything worked out great.

The good thing about using array was it's reuseabilty, so i just declared it once at the top and used everywhere in my program other then that it is easy to store multiple values in comparision with a varibles.One drawback is that we are declaring max size array which results in wastage of unnecessary memory.
we could also use switch statements and do while loop to solve this problem.

best practice to start iterating by zero is because the array starts with zero and ends with size-1 therefore we always start the iteration with 0. 

last week quiz was tricky although i knew most of the stuff i made very very stupid errors like forget to write "&" in scanf so i was disappointed by myself that how can make such silly mistakes at this point but rest was pretty well.
