The lab was fun i actually liked working with structs more than i like working with nested loops and arrays which we did in previous workshops because it sometimes confuse me, in this workshop i learned to work with arrays and structures combine, so we used struct instead of parallel arrays, parallel arrays are hard tu work with in order to add another field we have to add another array plus we can use multiple data types inside a struct, we added different information for the employees in just one struct and i would be much harder to work with parallel arrays. We can make another header file in which, the struct employee can be declared. Later, we just have to include that file in the source file. For example, we can make employee.h to declare the employee struct and afterwards just include that file in emp_athome.c.
