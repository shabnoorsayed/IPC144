A function is a block of code or a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least one function, which is main(). we can also define multiple other functions in our program and divide up our code into separate function. logically the division is such that each function performs a specific task.
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function.The C standard library provides numerous built-in functions that our program can call. A function can also be referred as a method or a sub-routine or a procedure, etc.The second reason for careful use of functions and procedures is to help define a logical structure for your program by breaking it down into a number of smaller modules with obvious purposes. Depending on the programming language you use, you can also compile a library of functions and procedures and import them for use in other programs.

The "helper" module has been made to avoid confusion between the different types of functions. In the "helper" functions, common functions have been created and called, and the "contacts" functions concentrate on the more basic functions like Name, Addresses, and Contacts. Merging them in one, would have created a lot of confusion and would have made the code really long.
