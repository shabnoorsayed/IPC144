I really enjoyed working on this workshop both in lab and at home parts were fun to work as i really like working with loops so i struglled less with this workshop in particular, i didn't use pseducode but i used flow chart to understand the problem fully before starting to work on it as i have as mentioned to my professor in class that it is hard to make sense of the problem just by looking at the steps and i would like to have a brief description of the problem at the start of workshop files so instead of follwing the steps provided to code we can also use our critical thinking to form solutions.

for my in lab part i just used for loop and while to solve everything but for at home solution i also used if statements as we wanted to store the values to calculate the means and also the highest and lowest tempreature.

I didn't used visual studio debugger as i am still learning it and trying to get a hang of it therefore to test my calculations i used printf() at multiple places where i felt i need to check any value.
