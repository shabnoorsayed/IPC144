the assingment was a bit difficult as we were working with structs ans thats like the whole new concept for me which i need to practice, the assignment asked us to code a struct, contacts and we have to store other structs in it, this make our program logically more neat as we store all logically related data types in one making it easier to manage.
It took me really really long to understand the secong part of the reflection question and that was the sole reason i am submitting this milestone a bit late, and i still haven't figured out what this part wants from me, i can re submitt this part if needed, with a bit of explaination from what is asked.
