This was one of the most challenging milestones, personally i don't enjoy working with pointer but we have the assignment requirment so i learned alot while doing all the milestones. Along with arrays, structure and pointers i also learned how to use addresses and purpose of including .c and .h files while working with modular programs.The function findContactIndex, compares the phone numbers stored already to the phone number that the user is searching for to edit the contact list. We learned how to compare a string using the string library that made the comparison really easy and convenient. Just like strcmp(to compare to strings) , we can use strlen (to count the number of characters), strcpy(to copy the content of one file to the other) and strcat(appends the contents of a file, using the data from the other file).
getTenDigitPhone, in one go, validates two things, the length of the phone number entered, and in the second validation, the type of characters entered.This function reduced the scope of putting in any wrong entries in the phone number field of the contact list.
Yes, that would have made it easier, we wouldn't have to enter each and every information again and again, we could maybe just refer to that text data file, and vice versa.
It would have also saved us a lot of space in terms of keeping all the details within the program, we could have just referred to the data text file.
