milestone 1 was very easy as we just had to make structs, milesstone on the other hand was intersting the challenging part for me surprisingly was not logic but the spaces as we had to use %[^\n]%*c at places where we are asking for inputs from users, the more efficent way to ask for an input is to use a function and call that function at multiple times as we are writing that same code again and again, for example when we asked for contacts first name, middle name and last name. if we try using %s a primative array char wouldn't automatically get the null terminator so it can give errors, a primitive char array adds the null terminater only if the size of the array isn't met so if the array is full of character it won't add null terminator.
